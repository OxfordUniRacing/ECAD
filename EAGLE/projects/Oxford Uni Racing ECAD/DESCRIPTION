Main project for Oxford Uni Racing ECAD <br><br>

This project includes all schematics and board designs that will go on the car. <br><br>

Structure - Divided into folders for corresponding boards (VCU, Wheel board, Pedal board etc.). Every folder contains one schematic with different sheets for corresponding modular design (ASS, CAN breakout, IO breakout, Power delivery etc.) <br><br>

Templates - as the boards will share some features (General layout, Power delivery, CAN breakout etc.) it would be useful to implement them as templates (both on the schematic and board level) and import them when working on a new board.
